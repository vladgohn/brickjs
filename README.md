# BRICK Micro-Framework

BRICK is a lightweight, client-side templating framework designed for simple and efficient management of HTML templates in web applications. This framework is built to simplify the integration of HTML snippets into the DOM, making it easier to render and update UI components with dynamic data.

## Features

- **Simplicity**: With BRICK, you can keep your HTML templates clean and separate from your JavaScript logic.
- **Efficiency**: It leverages JavaScript's template literals for straightforward template syntax without any new syntax to learn.
- **Flexibility**: BRICK can easily be used with or without jQuery and allows specifying alternative paths to organize your templates.
- **Client-side Rendering**: Enables dynamic data binding on the client side, making it ideal for single-page applications or projects where server-side rendering is not needed.

## Installation

To get started with BRICK, include the `brick.js` script in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="path/to/brick.js"></script>
```
